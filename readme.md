## Assignment
In class we worked out how to call the Bored API (Links to an external site.) using query parameters! Let's add a new features to our program so we can ask the user what kind of activity they might want.

### Ask the user for the following parameters:
1. What is the number of participants?
2. What is the activity key? (This is for autograding purposes and sanity check!)

Send the request while passing in the parameters and have your program list just the received activities.
Then print out just the activities

### Sample Output:
```
***Activity Generator *** 
How many participants? 4       
What is the key of the activity you're looking for? 5585829
Recommended Activity: Go to an escape room
```

### BONUS:
As a bonus exercise, try doing these requests in the browser or on Postman or try to add in extra parameters! You can even try looking up your own API.
